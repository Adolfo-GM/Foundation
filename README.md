# AGGM Foundation Module

A lightweight, dependency-free Python module for text manipulation, random number generation, and procedural ASCII art creation. Built with simplicity and portability in mind, this module uses only Python's built-in libraries (`math`, `random`, `time`) to provide a foundation for educational projects, prototypes, or creative experiments.

## Features

- **LLM (Lightweight Language Model)**: Basic text processing and generation.
  - Find next or previous words in a text.
  - Pick random words.
  - Generate simple text sequences using a Markov-like approach.
- **Dice Simulator**: Roll virtual dice with any number of sides.
- **Image Generator**: Create ASCII art using simplified Perlin noise, with themed character palettes (e.g., "cloudy," "forest").
- **Utility Functions**: Get the current time, date, and mathematical constants (Ï€ and e).

## Installation

No external dependencies required! Simply download the `foundation.py` file and run it with Python 3.x:
